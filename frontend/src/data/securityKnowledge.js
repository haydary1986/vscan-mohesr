    importance: 'critical',
    attackScenario: 'Without SSL, an attacker on the same network (e.g., public WiFi) can use tools like Wireshark to intercept all traffic between users and the server, capturing login credentials, session tokens, and personal data (Man-in-the-Middle attack).',

    title: 'Security Headers',
    description: 'HTTP security headers instruct browsers to enable built-in security features that protect against common web attacks like XSS, clickjacking, and data injection.',
    importance: 'high',
    attackScenario: 'Missing security headers leave the website vulnerable to multiple attacks. For example, without X-Frame-Options, an attacker can embed the site in an iframe and trick users into clicking hidden buttons (clickjacking).',
  },
  cookies: {
    title: 'Cookie Security',
    description: 'Cookies store session data and authentication tokens. Insecure cookie configuration can allow attackers to steal user sessions.',
    importance: 'high',
    attackScenario: 'Cookies without the HttpOnly flag can be stolen via XSS attacks using JavaScript (document.cookie). Without the Secure flag, cookies are sent over unencrypted HTTP connections where they can be intercepted.',

    title: 'Server Information Exposure',
    description: 'Server headers and CMS detection reveal the technology stack used. This information helps attackers find known vulnerabilities specific to those technologies.',
    importance: 'medium',
    attackScenario: 'If the server reveals it runs "Apache 2.4.49", an attacker can search for CVE-2021-41773 (path traversal vulnerability) and exploit it directly. Similarly, knowing the CMS version helps attackers use automated exploit tools.',
  },
  directory: {
    title: 'Directory & Sensitive File Exposure',
    description: 'Sensitive files and directories (like .env, .git, admin panels) should never be publicly accessible. They often contain credentials, configuration data, or provide administrative access.',
    importance: 'critical',
    attackScenario: 'An exposed .env file reveals database credentials, API keys, and secrets. An exposed .git directory allows attackers to download the entire source code. An accessible admin panel can be brute-forced to gain full control of the website.',

    title: 'HTTP Methods Security',
    description: 'HTTP methods like TRACE, DELETE, PUT should be disabled on production servers. Leaving dangerous methods enabled allows attackers to manipulate server resources.',
    importance: 'high',

    title: 'Information Disclosure',
    description: 'Information disclosure occurs when the server reveals internal details like technology versions, file paths, error messages, or debug information that help attackers plan targeted attacks.',
    importance: 'medium',
    attackScenario: 'Error pages revealing "PHP 7.2.1" and "/var/www/html" paths allow attackers to search for specific CVEs for that PHP version and target the exact file system structure.',

    importance: 'high',
    attackScenario: 'Poor hosting infrastructure with HTTP/1.1 only, no compression, and slow DNS makes the site vulnerable to performance-based attacks and provides a degraded user experience. Lack of IPv6 excludes a growing portion of internet users.',

  content: {
    title: 'Content Optimization',
    description: 'Evaluates content delivery optimization including caching headers, page size, and compression effectiveness. Proper caching reduces server load and improves page load speed.',
    importance: 'medium',
    attackScenario: 'Without proper cache headers, every request hits the origin server, making it easier to overwhelm with traffic. Large uncompressed pages waste bandwidth and increase load times, degrading user experience and SEO rankings.',

    title: 'Advanced Security Headers',
    description: 'Modern cross-origin isolation headers (COEP, COOP, CORP) and OCSP Stapling provide defense-in-depth against sophisticated attacks like Spectre, cross-origin data leaks, and certificate validation delays.',
    importance: 'medium',
    attackScenario: 'Without cross-origin isolation, a malicious iframe or popup can exploit Spectre-class vulnerabilities to read sensitive data from the victim\'s browsing context. Without OCSP Stapling, certificate revocation checks add latency and may fail silently.',

    title: 'Threat Intelligence',
    description: 'Advanced threat detection including cryptojacking resource abuse, Command & Control (C2) server communication, DNS blacklist checking, and domain age/reputation analysis via WHOIS/RDAP data.',
    importance: 'critical',
    attackScenario: 'Compromised sites may silently mine cryptocurrency using visitor CPU, communicate with C2 servers to receive attack commands, or be listed on blacklists indicating prior malicious activity. New or recently registered domains hosting important services may indicate domain hijacking.',
