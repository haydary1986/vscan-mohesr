## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- Node.js 20+
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Running Locally

```bash
# Clone your fork

cd vscan-mohesr

# Backend
cd backend
go run ./cmd/main.go

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend runs on `http://localhost:8080` and the frontend on `http://localhost:5173`.

Default credentials: `admin` / `admin123`

## Coding Standards

### Backend (Go)

- Follow standard Go conventions (`gofmt`, `go vet`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Handle all errors explicitly
- Write tests for new scanners and API endpoints

### Frontend (Vue.js)

- Use Composition API with `<script setup>`
- Follow Vue.js style guide (Priority A and B rules)
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Keep components focused and under 400 lines

### Adding a New Scanner

1. Create `backend/internal/scanner/your_scanner.go`
2. Implement the scanner interface with `Scan()` method
3. Register the scanner in `scanner.go`
4. Add OWASP/CWE mappings in `owasp.go`
5. Add remediation steps in `remediation.go`
6. Write tests in `your_scanner_test.go`

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Include a clear description of what changed and why
- Reference related issues (e.g., "Closes #42")
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if the public API changes
